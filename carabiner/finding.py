# A credential is a long *unbroken* run of token characters. Slashes, dots and

# `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` and `gcr.io/distroless/base-debian13` were both
# being mangled into unreadable stubs, which quietly damaged every finding that
# named an action or an image. Splitting on those separators keeps identifiers
# legible while still catching keys, which have no separators to split on.

# The one shape the rule above cannot see, and the one this tool reports on

#
# Splitting on separators is what keeps identifiers legible, and a password is
# free to contain exactly those separators. `Tr0ub4dor-3-correct-horse` is four
# runs of under twenty characters and passes through untouched; so does an AWS
# secret key, whose slashes cut it into runs of 13, 7 and 18. REPO004 puts a
# git remote line into a snippet, so that was a real credential reaching a
# report and, through SARIF, a code-scanning alert.
#
# Matched by *shape*, never by entropy. A scheme, a userinfo colon and an `@`
# are unambiguous; an entropy heuristic would eventually decide that
# `MyOrg123/some-long-action-name` is a secret and mangle the identifiers the
# rule above exists to protect.
#
# The password may contain slashes, so this deliberately over-reaches: a URL
# like `https://host:8080/path@x` loses its port and path. That is the right
# direction to be wrong in *here*, and it is the opposite of the rule this tool
# applies to findings. A false positive in a report wastes an afternoon; a
# false negative in a redactor puts a live credential in a code-scanning
# alert.
