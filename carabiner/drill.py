"""The drill: verify controls fire, rather than that they are configured.

Everything else in carabiner reads files. This reads outcomes. A pre-commit hook
listed in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that nobody ran `pre-commit install` for is
the single most common "we have secret scanning" that does not -- and it is
invisible to every static checker, including ours, because the configuration is
perfect. The only way to know is to plant a credential and see what happens.

The governing rule, same as the engines: **a drill that could not run never
reports as passing.** Unverified is not secure, and a green check you did not
earn is worse than no check.
