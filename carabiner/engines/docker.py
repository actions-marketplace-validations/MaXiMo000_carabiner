"""Dockerfile security. Native -- our own code, no wrapper.

Trivy scans a *built image*: it needs a daemon, a build, and minutes. A
Dockerfile is text, and the mistakes that matter most are visible in it before
anything is built. That gap is why this engine exists rather than shelling out.

Deliberately not checked here: package CVEs. Trivy and osv-scanner do that far
better, and two tools reporting one problem is how a scanner loses trust.
