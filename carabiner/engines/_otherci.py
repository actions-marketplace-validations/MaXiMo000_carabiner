"""Jenkins, CircleCI and Azure Pipelines.

Closes the last host gap. The vulnerability is the same one in every dialect:
text somebody else controls reaching a shell without ever becoming data.

Jenkinsfiles are Groovy, so this is regex-level rather than parsed -- stated
plainly because it means the coverage is shallower than the GitHub and GitLab
engines, not because Groovy is hard.

# Groovy interpolates ${...} -- and, in a GString, bare $identifier.property
# with no braces at all -- inside DOUBLE quotes before the shell ever sees it,
# so a build parameter lands in the command as code. Single quotes do not
# interpolate, which is why the quote style is the whole finding.
#
# A named, backreferenced quote group rather than a literal `"` on both ends:
# `sh """...multi-line..."""` (a real, common Jenkinsfile shape for anything
# longer than one line) opened with the same regex used to look identical to
# `sh ""` immediately followed by unrelated text, because the first two
# quotes of the triple satisfied an open-then-close pair with nothing between
# them -- measured against a real triple-quoted step, not assumed safe
# because the un-tripled case worked. DOTALL is required for that same
# multi-line body to be seen as one string rather than stopping at the first
# newline.
