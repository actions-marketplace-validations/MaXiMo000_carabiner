"""Vulnerable dependencies. Wraps osv-scanner.

The plan called for pip-audit, npm audit and osv-scanner. It gets one: osv-scanner
reads lockfiles for PyPI, npm, Go, Maven, crates.io, RubyGems and more from the
same OSV database the others draw from, so shipping three parsers would be three
times the maintenance for the same findings. Add pip-audit only if someone
reports a case osv-scanner genuinely misses.

Advisory ids are normalized to a canonical form before they become findings.
Without that, osv-scanner's GHSA-xxxx and pip-audit's PYSEC-xxxx for the same
vulnerability are two different fingerprints, and the developer sees one problem
reported twice -- which costs trust faster than a missed finding.
