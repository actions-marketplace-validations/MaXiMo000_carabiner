"""Secrets. Wraps gitleaks -- never reimplements it.

gitleaks is better at this than anything written here would be, and its rule
set is maintained by people who do nothing else. carabiner's job is to
normalize the output, sort history findings from working-tree ones, and put
them in the ratchet.

History matters more than the working tree: a secret deleted in a later commit
is still in the pack file and still needs rotating. Deleting the file is not
remediation, which is why those are reported one severity higher.
